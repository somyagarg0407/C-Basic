Array is itself a pointer and contaions the address of first variable;

----------task 3 important----------------  

arr → address of arr[0]
arr + 1 → address of arr[1]
arr + 2 → address of arr[2]\

------------(arr + i) == &arr[i]-------------

arr[i] == *(arr + i) == *(p + i)    if   int*p=arr

📌 That’s why these two function parameters are equivalent: 
func(int arr[])
func(int* arr)

❌ Thinking array is copied to function
❌ Using sizeof(arr) inside function
❌ Forgetting to pass size  

| Feature           | Pointer   | Reference |
| ----------------- | -------   | --------- |
| Stores address    | ✅ Yes   | ❌ No      |
| Another name      | ❌ No    | ✅ Yes     |
| Can be NULL       | ✅ Yes   | ❌ No      |
| Can change target | ✅ Yes   | ❌ No      |
| Needs dereference | ✅ Yes   | ❌ No      |


new returns the address of the allocated memory.

⚠️ Important tips (professional habits)
Always use delete for every new
Set pointer to nullptr after delete to avoid dangling pointer
Never mix delete and delete[] (array vs single)
